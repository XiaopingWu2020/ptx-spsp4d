# ptx-spsp4d
This is a matlab script for designing parallel transmit (pTx) 4D spatial spectral (spsp) RF pulses with kT point parameterization.
You may run the demo script, `demo.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design pTx 4D spsp (3D spatial + 1D spectral) pulses to create uniform water-selective excitation across the human brain using a 16-channel transmit RF coil at 10.5 Tesla. 
Note that the regularization tools (regtools) the pulse designer relies on are obtained from http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/Regutools/.

If you use the toolbox, please consider citing the following paper:
